# Steam-overlay-abusion

I've gotten a vivid inspiration when I first take a look at **[gameoverlayrenderer-imgui-dx9](https://github.com/aixxe/gameoverlayrenderer-imgui-dx9)**, 
so I decided to replicate this repository in alternative and simpler way which uses Minhook within the hooking process.

Basically, this technology allows you to render anything in completely invisible state on your stream.
This way you can stream any hacky stuff without letting viewers know that you're cheating.

### This project is work in progress.
